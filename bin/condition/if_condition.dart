// Conditions In Dart
// When you write a computer program, you need to be able to tell the computer,
// what to do in different situations. With conditions, 
//you can control the flow of the dart program. 
//Suppose you need to execute a specific code when a particular situation is true. 
//In that case, you can use conditions in Dart. 
//E.g., a calculator app must perform subtraction if the user presses the subtract button,
// and addition if the user taps the add button.

// Types Of Condition
// You can use following conditions to control the flow of your program.

// If Condition
// If-Else Condition
// If-Else-If Condition
// Switch case


// If Condition
// The easy and most common way of controlling the flow of a program is through the use of an if statement. 
//If statement allow us to execute a code block when the given condition is true. 
//Conditions evaluate boolean values.
