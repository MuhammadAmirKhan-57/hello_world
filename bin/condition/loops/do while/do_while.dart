// Do While Loop
// Do while loop is used to run a block of code multiple times. 
// The loopâ€™s body will be executed first, and then the condition is tested.

// First, it runs statements, and finally, the condition is checked.
// If the condition is true, the code inside {} is executed.
// The condition is re-checked until the condition is false.
// When the condition is false, the loop stops.

void main() {
  int i = 1;
  do {
    print(i);
    i++;
  } while (i <= 10);
}
