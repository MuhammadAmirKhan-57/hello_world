// Dart Loops
// In Programming, loops are used to repeat a block of code until certain conditions are not completed. 
//For, e.g., if you want to print your name 100 times, then rather than typing print(“your name”); 
//100 times, you can use a loop.
// There are different types of loop in Dart. They are:

// For Loop
// For Each Loop
// While Loop
// Do While Loop
