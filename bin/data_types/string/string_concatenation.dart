// String Concatenation
// You can combine one String with another string. This is called concatenation. 
// In Dart, you can use the + operator or use interpolation to concatenate the String.
//  Interpolation makes it easy to read and understand the code.

void main() {   
String firstName = "John";
String lastName = "Doe";
print("Using +, Full Name is "+firstName + " " + lastName+".");
print("Using interpolation, full name is $firstName $lastName.");  
  
}
